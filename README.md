# weather-script
A Python script to get the current weather of a city

I've made use of the "pyowm" library here. You need an API key to access the weather data from https://openweathermap.org/. A free one would work just fine. Just copy paste the API key in the highlighted area of the script. Then simply just run the script & enter the city name to get the weather details.
